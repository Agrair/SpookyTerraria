Hello and welcome to Spooky Terraria!

[c/00FF00:IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU]
[c/00FF00:USE THIS MOD WITH BETTERMECHANICS,]
[c/00FF00:A MOD ON THE MOD BROWSER THAT I MADE!]

This release may be final, but if there are any bugs, please let me know.
PLEASE LET ME KNOW ON DISCORD BY CLICKING ON THE HOMEPAGE LINK.

First of all, this was inspired by Slenderman: the 8 pages.

BE SURE TO CREATE A NEW CHARACTER WITH THIS MOD ENABLED FIRST.

[c/FF0000:TO PLAY THE SLENDER MAP MADE FOR]
[c/FF0000:TERRARIA!]

In this mod, your world gets a whole lot darker and creepier, along with a new NPC, the Stalker.
The stalker is a high stealth creature who can attack you when you least expect it, so be sure to use your flashlight accordingly.
The one way you will know the Stalker is near you is a heartbeat. Your heartbeat links to the Stalker. The faster your heartbeat gets, the closer you are.
Another thing: Heartrate is now an important factor in the mod.
If your heartrate goes above 240, you die.

Some extra spooky things like ambience have been added!
In the forest you can hear crickets, owls, and eerie winds.

At the ocean, you can hear crashing waves, which are loud.

In the snow, you can hear faint snowfall.

A NOTE TO ALL: This is intended for SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY.
There are no plans to make this multiplayer compatible, and as a result, I have prevented ALL loading into MP servers.

Have fun, and good luck!
